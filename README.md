## Kotlin Multiplatform Notes
This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, iOS and Web.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across the Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.

* `/iosApp` contains iOS applications. Even if the UI is being shared with Compose Multiplatform, 
  this entry point is being needed for the iOS app. This is also where SwiftUI code should be added.
